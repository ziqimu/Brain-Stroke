# Brain-Stroke

By examining around 5000 patients, I aim to classify cases based on factors such as BMI and average glucose levels to determine the risk of brain stroke. Using R, I am developing a predictive model that seeks to identify high-risk patients and provide insights into which indicators are most likely to contribute to brain stroke.
